This project is my **final assignment for the Web Atelier course**.  
It is a portfolio template website designed and developed from scratch, focused on:

- Responsive behavior across devices
- Clear structure and readability

The website showcases a hero section, an about section with horizontal scrolling, interactive elements, and a strong focus on motion and user experience.
